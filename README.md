# BIGTREETECH-MINI-UPS-V2.0
BigTree Technology Co., Ltd. developed this power failure module to detect a power failure during printing and ensuring the print can be resumed after power is returns.

BTT UPS 24V V1.0 is an external module of 3D printer with the function of power off resume print, which was launched by 3D printing
team of Shenzhen Big Tree Technology CO., LTD. It is applicable to all 3D printers powered by DC24V switch power, such as Ender 3 printer.

## Featureï¼š
- Adopt voltage comparator LM393 chip, which can detect power failure sensitively;
- Equipped with 9 2.7V 5F super capacitors to store electricity, so that there is sufficient power supply after detecting the power failure, then the printer can
successfully complete the corresponding operation.
- An anti-reverse protection circuit is added at the power interface to prevent irreversible damage caused by the reverse power supply, which greatly protects the
circuit board;
- The module is small and easy to install;
- Main function: realize the power off resume print function;
